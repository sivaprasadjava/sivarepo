@Deprecated annotation was introduced in java 5 version.
 A program element annotated with @Deprecated means it should not be used for any of the following reasons

	1.Its usage may leads to errors.
	2.It may be incompatible in future version.
	3.It may be removed in future version.
	4.A better and efficient alternative has superseded it.

Compiler generates warnings whenever a deprecated element is used. With Java 9, 
two new enhancements are made to @Deprecated annotation.

	1.forRemoval − Indicates whether the annotated element is subject to removal in a future version. The default value is false.

	2.since − Returns the version in which the annotated element became deprecated. The default value is the empty string.
