Multi Java Version Module JAR Files
-----------------------------------
	From Java 9 it is possible to create JAR files for Java modules which contains code compiled specifically for different versions of Java.
 That means, that you can create a JAR file for your module that contains code compiled for Java 8, Java 9, Java 10 etc. all within
the same JAR file.

Here is how the structure looks of a multi Java version JAR file:


 jar root
  - A.class
  - B.class
  - C.class
  - D.class
  - META-INF
     - versions
        - 9
           - A.class
           - B.class
        - 10
           - A.class
 			
		The com folder at the root level of the JAR file contains the compiled Java classes for pre Java 9 versions.Earlier versions
of Java do not understand multi Java version JAR files so they use the classes found here.Therefore you can only support one Java 
version earlier than Java 9.

 The META-INF directory contains the MANIFEST.MF file and a directory named versions.
 The MANIFEST.MF file needs a special entry that marks the JAR file as a multi version JAR file. Here is how this entry looks:

		Multi-Release: true

					The versions directory which can contain the compiled classes for different versions of Java for your module. 
In the example above there are two subdirectories inside the versions directory. One subdirectory for Java 9, and one for Java 10.
The names of the directories correspond to the numbers of the Java versions to support.
